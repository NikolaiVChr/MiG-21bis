S-24 rockets have a 0.1 second interval delay in firing
if only one S-24 rocket is attached to the wings, the stick deflection required on takeoff is 1/5 - 1/4 sideways
autopilot stick deflection required would equal approx 0.1 for elevator and 0.15 for aileron
(above 3 gleaned from pilots manual pp 167)
s-5 rockets launch from inboard pylons first (pp 168)
UB-32 pods report as empty after 16 rockets are fired, the light will go out again with the next salvo (pp 169)
S-5 minimum firing distance = 1200m, S-24 minimum firing distance = 1600m (pp 169)
B1-4 position on the armament selector drops all bombs at once. (pp174)
bombs should drop as a salvo, no interval delay (pp174)
operating the emergency jettison switch will also release bombs (pp174)
