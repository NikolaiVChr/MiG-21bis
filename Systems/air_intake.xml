<!-- offangle = atan with beta = adj and alpha = opp -->

The MiG-21 has an inlet cone that disrupts and slows the air flow. The cone
can travel forwards and backwards. The plane also has anti-surge doors
on either side of the fuselage, after the inlet but before the engine fans.

I've no actual data on how much of an off angle was required to get an
engine surge. Stall is at ~33 degrees, and there are videos showing
a MiG-21 pilot flying at ~25 degrees. I'm guessing we can start the odds of
a surge at ~22 degrees, and ramp up the odds to ~35 degrees.

In addition, smoke from rockets or missiles had a chance to kill the engine.
